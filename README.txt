Nabeess Lubricants — Multi-page static website
----------------------------------------------

What's included:
- index.html, about.html, products.html, certifications.html, contact.html
- styles.css, script.js
- All images are hotlinked from Unsplash so they show immediately when hosted (no local images).

Working contact form:
- The contact form uses Formsubmit.co in this demo. To make it deliver messages to your email:
  1) Open contact.html and find the form action: https://formsubmit.co/info@nabeess.example
  2) Replace the action URL with https://formsubmit.co/your-email@example.com (use your real email)
  3) Alternatively, sign up for Formspree (https://formspree.io) and replace the action with your Formspree endpoint.
  4) After first submission, Formsubmit will send a confirmation to that email. Follow the instructions in that email to enable submissions.

Hosting:
- Upload the folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel). If you use Netlify, you can also enable Netlify Forms instead of Formsubmit.

Customization:
- Change logos at the top by editing the <img> src in the header of each page.
- Replace any Unsplash image URL with your own hosted image if you prefer local control.

Zip contains all HTML, CSS and JS. Ready to deploy — just unzip and upload the folder.
